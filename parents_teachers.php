				<h2>Adolescence</h2>
				<p>The transition from childhood to adulthood is one of the most dynamic in human development. The rate of physical, emotional, and intellectual change during adolescence is second only to infancy. As their bodies and brains shift through this extensive remodeling, adolescents transition from the care of others to become their own health and wellness managers.</p> 
				<p>That’s why it is essential to lay a strong foundation for adolescents so they can successfully move from home to the complicated world around them and see their future as healthy adults.</p> 
				<p>These years of development are when life-long patterns of healthy behavior are established. By recognizing, respecting, and protecting adolescence as a developmental stage, parents can foster safer, healthier and more responsible adolescents.</p> 
				<p>This period of development is the perfect time to help them develop positive adult relationships, provide reliable information, and develop strong links to the health care community.  It’s a balance. On one hand, you want to guide them around the pitfalls of adolescence; on the other you want to encourage their independence.</p> 
				<p>Each setting where young people live, learn, work, play and worship provides opportunities for youth to strengthen their attitudes toward their bodies and health.  Although studies show that adolescents learn primarily from their friends, they also want to learn from their parents and community leaders. This is good news; it means parents, teacher, and other trusted adults can nudge them away from hazards, direct them toward healthy choices, and help them navigate the developmental tasks of adolescence.</p>

				<h2>Factors That Affect Adolescent Health</h2>
				<p>Most health risk factors among adolescents are interrelated. Youth who engage in 
				one unhealthy behavior, smoking or drinking for example, are more likely to develop 
				a cluster of unhealthy behaviors and habits. Likewise, many protective factors such 
				as good nutrition or trusted relationships with adults, are interrelated and increase 
				the likelihood for healthy adolescent development. Reducing risk behaviors and 
				increasing protective factors positively affects health and well-being and helps 
				strengthen our youth to make healthy decisions, withstand life stressors, and grow 
				to become healthy adults who contribute positively to our community.</p>

				<h2>Talking About Sex</h2>
				<p>Talking to your child about sex and relationships can be difficult and you may 
				be tempted to put it off. But your child needs to learn about these subjects to 
				stay safe and grow to become a healthy, happy adult. As a parents, you are in 
				the best position to give your child the information they need and the advice 
				they want.</p>
				<p><b><i>Top Tips:</i></b></p>
				<ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 20px">
				<li>Be honest about your feelings.</li> 
				<li>It’s perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable, maybe even embarrassed, by 
				some of your children’s questions. You might find support and 
				encouragement from other adults if you share your experiences with 
				friends and other parents who know exactly where you are coming from.</li> 
				<li>If you don’t know the answer to a question, say so. But make a 
				commitment to find out and report back. Or better, find the answer 
				together.</li> 
				<li>When it’s appropriate, use humor. Laughing with your teen can help 
				takes the stress down a notch and help keep everyone feeling more 
				comfortable.</li> 
				<li>Think about your child’s particular questions. Is it curiosity or is there an 
				underlying anxiety that needs your attention?</li> 
				<li>When you talk together, find out what they already know and understand
				by asking gently probing questions like, ‘What do you think it means?’ 
				This gives you a good opportunity to correct wrong information if 
				necessary</li> 
				<li>Remember that the responses to questions received by young children 
				will lay the foundations for patterns of communication in later years. 
				Treat the questions seriously and make every effort to respond 
				effectively.</li> 
				<li>If it is helpful, use books, brochures or pictures to explain things, though 
				take care about the images you choose. One of our staff members 
				remembers her beloved mother drawing detailed, anatomical drawings 
				for her when she barely 7-years old. She laughs about it now but recalls 
				being a little scared and confused by the images.</li> 
				<li>Take care to finish your conversations by praising your child for asking 
				question and reminding them that you are always available and happy 
				for them to come to you with any future questions.</li> 
				<li>Remember that children need facts but they also need to be able to 
				share feelings and concerns and to seek guidance in making decisions. 
				Be the trusted adult they need to navigate this exciting, sometimes 
				confusing time.</li>

				<h2>Student Health Forms</h2>
	
				<p>Healthy students have better attendance and perform better, both academically and socially. Supporting a child’s health needs at school requires good communication between parents and school staff. It’s vitally important that the principal, school nurse, and classroom teachers are aware of their student’s health needs. To ensure consistent care at school, the following forms are required for the administration of medication, self-management, and instructions on what to do in the event of an emergency.</p>
