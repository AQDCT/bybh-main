				<h2>Adolescence</h2>
				<p>The transition from childhood to adulthood is one of the most dynamic in human development. The rate of physical, emotional, and intellectual change during adolescence is second only to infancy. As their bodies and brains shift through this extensive remodeling, adolescents transition from the care of others to become their own health and wellness managers.</p> 
				<p>That’s why it is essential to lay a strong foundation for adolescents so they can successfully move from home to the complicated world around them and see their future as healthy adults.</p> 
				<p>These years of development are when life-long patterns of healthy behavior are established. By recognizing, respecting, and protecting adolescence as a developmental stage, parents can foster safer, healthier and more responsible adolescents.</p> 
				<p>This period of development is the perfect time to help them develop positive adult relationships, provide reliable information, and develop strong links to the health care community.  It’s a balance. On one hand, you want to guide them around the pitfalls of adolescence; on the other you want to encourage their independence.</p> 
				<p>Each setting where young people live, learn, work, play and worship provides opportunities for youth to strengthen their attitudes toward their bodies and health.  Although studies show that adolescents learn primarily from their friends, they also want to learn from their parents and community leaders. This is good news; it means parents, teacher, and other trusted adults can nudge them away from hazards, direct them toward healthy choices, and help them navigate the developmental tasks of adolescence.</p>

				<h2>Factors That Affect Adolescent Health</h2>
				<p>Most health risk factors among adolescents are interrelated. Youth who engage in

				<h2>The Parent's Guide to Sexual Abuse</h2>
<p><strong>What is child sexual abuse?</strong></p>
<p>In the broadest definition, child sexual abuse is any forced or coerced sexual activity involving a child. Bribes or other tricks may be used. Often, the abuser persuades the child to cooperate and to keep the abuse a secret.</p>
<p><strong>If my child has been sexually abused, what can I do?</strong></p>
<p>Sexual abuse is upsetting and confusing for children and parents. <br>
  Being informed will help you make good decisions. <br>
  Talk with your child and let her or him be involved in decisions. <br>
  Your child needs to know that you are not afraid or upset and that you are listening to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p> After the abuse, the behavior of your child may change for a time. You may notice any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Heightened fear or anxiety</li>
  <li>Increased tearfulness or crying</li>
  <li>Disturbed sleeping patterns</li>
  <li>Loss of appetite</li>
  <li>Irritable nature, losing patience easily</li>
  <li>Temper tantrums</li>
  <li>Isolation or secrecy</li>
  <li>Difficulty at school, such as poor concentration and loss of interest in classroom activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How should I respond? </strong></p>
<p>After learning your child has been sexually abused, try to respond with patience and kindness to your child, yourself, and your family. Try these suggestions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Help</strong> your child to express their feelings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do not blame</strong> the child for what has happened. Tell your child that you are not angry with her or&nbsp;him and that they did nothing wrong.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Let your child know</strong> that you      are concerned and want to help them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Restore</strong> your child's sense of control.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do not push</strong> your child      to talk about the experience. If the subject comes up, discuss it       honestly and openly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Maintain routines</strong> and return      to your family's usual activities as soon as possible. Don't become too protective of       your child.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pay attention</strong> to the      needs of other children in your household.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Discuss</strong> your feelings with someone you      trust. This is not a time for you to       be "tough." It is a good time to seek       support for yourself.</li>

				<h2>Talking About Sex</h2>
				<p>Talking to your child about sex and relationships can be difficult and you may 
				be tempted to put it off. But your child needs to learn about these subjects to 
				stay safe and grow to become a healthy, happy adult. As a parents, you are in 
				the best position to give your child the information they need and the advice 
				they want.</p>
				<p><b><i>Top Tips:</i></b></p>
				<ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 20px">
				<li>Be honest about your feelings.</li> 
				<li>It’s perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable, maybe even embarrassed, by 
				some of your children’s questions. You might find support and 
				encouragement from other adults if you share your experiences with 
				friends and other parents who know exactly where you are coming from.</li> 
				<li>If you don’t know the answer to a question, say so. But make a 
				commitment to find out and report back. Or better, find the answer 
				together.</li> 
				<li>When it’s appropriate, use humor. Laughing with your teen can help 
				takes the stress down a notch and help keep everyone feeling more 
				comfortable.</li> 
				<li>Think about your child’s particular questions. Is it curiosity or is there an 
				underlying anxiety that needs your attention?</li> 
				<li>When you talk together, find out what they already know and understand
				by asking gently probing questions like, ‘What do you think it means?’ 
				This gives you a good opportunity to correct wrong information if 
				necessary</li> 
				<li>Remember that the responses to questions received by young children 
				will lay the foundations for patterns of communication in later years. 
				Treat the questions seriously and make every effort to respond 
				effectively.</li> 
				<li>If it is helpful, use books, brochures or pictures to explain things, though 
				take care about the images you choose. One of our staff members 
				remembers her beloved mother drawing detailed, anatomical drawings 
				for her when she barely 7-years old. She laughs about it now but recalls 
				being a little scared and confused by the images.</li> 
				<li>Take care to finish your conversations by praising your child for asking 
				question and reminding them that you are always available and happy 
				for them to come to you with any future questions.</li> 
				<li>Remember that children need facts but they also need to be able to 
				share feelings and concerns and to seek guidance in making decisions. 
				Be the trusted adult they need to navigate this exciting, sometimes 
				confusing time.</li>

				<h2>Youth-Friendly Health Care – What Young People Say is Important to Them</h2>
				<p>When adults visit a health care facility, they want to be treated with respect by the provider.  It's no different for young people. Teens and young adults have specific criteria that they feel are important when accessing health care.</p>
<p>Here are some characteristics of health care that contribute to a young person's positive experience:</p>
<h3>Accessibility:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location, location, location!</strong> You can't get care if you can't get there.</li>
    <li><strong>Affordability</strong>. Young people often have limited financial resources, so pricing is key. No one wants to be surprised when something is more expensive than they thought it would be.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Staff attitude:</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><strong>R-E-S-P-E-C-T</strong> Young people want to feel like their medical provider is respectful and supportive of them</li>

    <li><strong>Just trust me.</strong> Young people want honest and trustworthy providers.  If you don't trust someone, you don't feel like you can be honest with them and discuss sensitive topics</li>
    <li><strong>Friends first.</strong> Friendliness goes beyond smiling and being polite.  Young people say it's nice to have a provider who is interested in the nonmedical aspects of their lives and "treats them like a friend". Patients also appreciate when a provider shares their own personal experiences with them, whether it has to do with the visit or not.</li>
    </ul>
 
 <h3>Communication:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Listen up! </strong> Young people want a provider who is a good listener</li>
    <li><strong>Straight talk.</strong> Providers should be clear and use a direct style when communicating with patients, but be careful not to use a lecturing tone.</li>
    </ul>


<h3>Medical competency of the provider:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ouch!</strong> Avoiding and managing pain is really important to young people. They don't want to feel physically uncomfortable during an examination, while getting a shot or getting blood drawn. Be gentle, and explain when things might hurt!</li>
    </ul>
 
<h3>Guideline-driven care:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Give me the whole picture.</strong> Young people want a regular assessment of their overall health, which will change based on life events and personal goals.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Keep it confidential.</strong> Sensitive topics like reproductive and mental health demand an understanding of confidentiality between patient and provider.</li>

    <li><strong>Independence. </strong> As young people transition into adulthood, they need a certain amount of guidance, but they also say that their autonomy, or independence is really important.</li>
    </ul>



<h3>Age appropriate environments:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Be flexible. </strong>Young people appreciate flexibility in office hours and scheduling appointments to avoid school absenteeism</li>
    <li><strong>Give me space.</strong> Young people appreciate having a separate space for youth-focused care, including handouts specifically for them.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't make me wait. </strong>If you're kept waiting, it may feel like the provider doesn't respect you enough to make time for you. If I have to wait, keep me entertained with games, TV, and a clean, welcoming waiting room.</li>
    <li><strong>Who are you again? </strong>It's important that young people experience continuity, and that they see the same provider whenever they visit. This is important to establish trust.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy, please. </strong>Young people value their privacy, and it's important that they feel their privacy respected during their office visit.</li>
  </ul>


<h3>Youth involvement in health care:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Give me a say!</strong> Young people want to be involved in their care and feel like they understand their health and treatment.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Health outcomes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>How are things turning out?</strong> After the visit is over, young people want the tools that help them live their lives free of pain, to be able to manage their emotional health, and control their reproductive health.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Adolescent Dating Violence</h2>
<H3>Are school nurses ready to treat adolescent dating violence (ADV)?</H3>
<p><strong>What is ADV?</strong></p>
<p><em>Adolescent dating violence (ADV) is physical, sexual, or psychological/emotional violence within a dating relationship.</em></p>
<p><strong>One in every 11 adolescents report being a victim of ADV</strong>. Victims are at an increased risk for academic, legal, and health-related problems and are more likely to engage in risky behavior like binge drinking, suicide attempts, physical fights, alcohol and other drug abuse, and unsafe sex. </p>
<p>In a recent study conducted by Ball State University, more than half of high school nurses reported assisting a victim of adolescent dating violence (ADV) in the past two years , yet 86% of nurses reported they did not have a protocol in their schools to respond to an incident of ADV.  </p><p>[INSERT CHART]</p><p>
  Nurses who had a school protocol for responding to ADV reported fewer problems in assisting victims of ADV, and were able to help more victims of ADV as compared to nurses who did not have a protocol in place. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Barriers to Assisting ADV Victims</strong><br>
  More than half of the high school nurses identified the major obstacle to treating ADV victims is not having the <strong>training</strong> to help. In addition, lack of <strong>private space and time</strong> were reported as barriers. </p>
<p><strong>Legal Issues </strong><br>
  In the US, a majority of states&mdash;including Illinois&mdash;have a policy stating that schools will provide assistance for physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; however, in the absence of adequate staff training on ADV, it is likely that student victims will receive help they need. </p>
<p><strong>What can schools do?</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Schools should periodically assess the student body to get an      idea of how many students are affected by ADV. </li>
  <li>Continuing education and training should be provided for      school nurses and other personnel on how to assist student victims of ADV      and improve prevention efforts. </li>
  <li>Have a protocol in place to respond to an incident of ADV in      order to improve the outreach efforts for assisting victims of ADV.</li>

<h2>Youth in Foster Care at Greater Risk for Teen Pregnancy</h2>

<p>While all adolescents are at risk for teenage pregnancy and parenthood, some groups face more challenges than others. Youth living in foster care experience particular barriers that lead to disparate outcomes.</p>
<p>One-third of girls in foster care become pregnant at least once by age 17, and nearly one-half of them do so by age 19. </p>
<p>[INSERT CHART]</p>
<p>More than half of boys living in foster care reported getting someone pregnant by age 21, compared to 19 percent of boys who were not living in foster care.       </p>
<p>[INSERT CHART]</p>
<h3>Why does this difference exist?</h3>
<p>Youth in care may face multiple risk factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Histories of abuse and neglect</li>
  <li>Lack of a consistent, trusting, and caring adult in their lives</li>
  <li>Lack of opportunity to experience normal teenage relationships</li>
  <li>Desire for someone to love</li>
</ul>
<p>Youth in care may also have faced homelessness and poverty, putting them further at risk.</p>
<p>Many of these risks are out of the youth's control and depend on the child welfare system, which often lacks funding for the delivery of evidence-based and youth in care-oriented sex education programs.</p>
<p>A young person transitioning out of foster care, particularly as a young parent, can be a destabilizing time.</p>
<h3>So what can I do?</h3>
<p>Build a relationship based on trust and compassion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some foster youth have had few positive relationships with adults and some may have experienced abuse and neglect. It is important to let them know early and often that they are welcome in your home and that you care about them. </li>
</ul>
<p>Talk with your foster children about sex, and be specific. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Talking to your foster child about sex is not a one-time conversation. It is an ongoing, two-way dialogue. When you start the conversation, be honest, open, non-judgmental, and respectful. You will be a better communicator if you are sensitive to your foster child's culture, religion, and sexual orientation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Spend quality time with your foster child.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Teens who are close to their parents/foster parents and feel supported by them are more likely to wait before having sex and use contraception more consistently. Family activities like going to the movies or cooking dinner together are good examples of spending quality time with each other and are perfect opportunities to have conversations. </li>
</ul>
<p>Supervise and monitor your foster children and adolescents.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Establish rules, curfews, and standards of expected behavior through open discussion. This may be difficult since some children will try to test your parental limits, but most will respect you. Supervising and monitoring your foster child's whereabouts doesn't make you a nag; it makes you a caring foster parent. </li>
</ul>
<p>Know your foster children's friends and their families.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Friends have a strong influence on each other, both positive and negative. Meet the parents of your foster child's friends and try to establish common rules and expectations. Some foster teens may not want anyone to know they are in foster care and will be reluctant for their foster parents to meet their friends. Don't be discouraged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Know what your foster kids are watching, reading, and listening to.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Today, teenagers spend over 40 hours each week consuming media. It is important to talk with your foster children about what the media portrays and what you think about it. Encourage them to think critically and ask how what they see on TV relates to their life. </li>
</ul>
<p>Don't forget the boys—Talk to your foster sons and foster daughters. Avoid the double standard.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Teen girls don't get pregnant on their own. Boys may feel pressurized to prove something to their friends or impress a girl. Talk with girls and boys about the emotional and health consequences of sex, responsibility, love, and values. </li>
</ul>
<p>Discourage dating at an early age. Watch out for age differences in relationships.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take a stand against your daughter dating a boy significantly older than she and your son developing a relationship with a girl much younger than he. Set a limit of no more than two (at most three) year age difference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Encourage your foster child to become involved in positive activities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Getting involved in activities like sports, arts, community-service, faith-based activities, or other after-school programs will help the youth build confidence and self-esteem by mastering skills. Provide them with alternatives to engaging in risky behavior.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Help your foster teens to have options for the future that are more attractive than early pregnancy and parenthood. </p>
<ul>
  <li>If your foster child believes they have a successful future ahead of them they are more likely to delay sex, pregnancy, and parenthood. Help them set meaningful goals for the future and talk to them in concrete terms about what it will take to reach their goals. Provide help along the way.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong><a href="http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/fostercare/projects.aspx">Making Proud Choices! For Youth in Out-of-Home Care &amp; Integration of Teen Pregnancy Prevention into State and Local Child Welfare Systems</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and APHSA (American Public Human Services Association) is working on a project, <em>Integration of Teen Pregnancy Prevention into State and Local Child Welfare Systems</em>, to reduce the high rates of teen pregnancy among youth in foster care. The project is designed to use an evidence-based sex education curriculum for youth in care, train teams of child welfare and teen pregnancy professionals through an Institute Model in five states/communities, and implement this new curriculum into existing Independent Living (IL) and Transition Planning (TP) programs. </p>

<h2>Protecting the Rights of Pregnant and Parenting Youth</h2>
 <h3> A Resource for Parents and Providers</h3>
  <p><strong><em>Is your child pregnant or about to become a parent?</em></strong><strong> </strong><br>
  Their rights are protected under Title IX, which is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities. All students have the same right to be involved in educational programs and extracurricular activities, including school clubs, academic societies, and honors programs. It also prohibits discrimination against pregnant and parenting students. (Note: if your child attends a school run by a religious organization, it is excluded from Title IX). </p>
<p><strong><em>Can a school require a pregnant student to participate in a separate program? </em></strong><br>
  No. A school may suggest an alternate program or school for pregnant students, but participation must be voluntary and up to the student. Pregnant students are allowed to stay in their regular classes and school if they choose. </p>
<p><strong><em>Can a school require a pregnant student to obtain a doctor's permission before allowing her to attend school?</em></strong><strong> </strong><br>
  No. Schools cannot require a pregnant student to turn in a doctor's note in order to stay in school or participate in activities, unless a doctor's note is required by all students being treated by a doctor (for example, a school can't ask for a doctor's note from a pregnant student unless they require it for all students who see a doctor, like a student with asthma). </p>
<p><strong><em>What types of assistance must a school provide to a pregnant student at school? </em></strong><strong> </strong><br>
  Schools must make adjustments to the regular program in order to accommodate a student's temporary pregnancy status, like providing a larger desk or allowing frequent trips to the restroom. </p>
<p><strong><em>Does a school have to excuse absences due to pregnancy or childbirth?</em></strong><strong> </strong><br>
  Yes. Under Title IX schools must excuse absences due to a student's pregnancy or related conditions for as long as the student's doctor thinks medically necessary. </p>
<p><strong><em>What if some teachers have their own policies about class attendance and make-up work? </em></strong><br>
  It's the school's responsibility to make sure that the policies of individual teachers do not discriminate against pregnant students. A pregnant student must be allowed to submit work after a deadline that she missed due to an absence relating to her pregnancy. If grading is based on class attendance or participation then the student should be allowed to earn the credits she missed. </p>
<p><strong><em>How do I file a complaint of discrimination?</em></strong><strong> </strong><br>
  If your child has been teased by classmates, left out of school programs, or not allowed to sign up for difficult classes due to a pregnancy, she can file a complaint of discrimination with the <u>Office of Civil Rights (OCR)</u>. [Text "Office of Civil Rights (OCR)" should be a link to <a href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html">http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/complaintintro.html</a>] </p>
<p>For more details about rights under Title IX, and how to file a complaint and questions you may have about the law, read the report <u>Supporting the Academic Success of Pregnant and Parenting Students</u>.

				<h2>Student Health Forms</h2>
	
				<p>Healthy students have better attendance and perform better, both academically and socially. Supporting a child’s health needs at school requires good communication between parents and school staff. It’s vitally important that the principal, school nurse, and classroom teachers are aware of their student’s health needs. To ensure consistent care at school, the following forms are required for the administration of medication, self-management, and instructions on what to do in the event of an emergency.</p>
