			<p style="padding-top:20px">Adolescents occupy a very special place in the world, standing squarely between childhood and adulthood. Scientifically documented as the most tumultuous time in one’s life, adolescence can also be the ripest: Ripe for planting healthy behaviors that take root, ripe for changing unhealthy patterns into nourishing ones, ripe for guiding to healthfulness. Too often, the emotional and physical health of our adolescents takes a back seat to the needs of infants and toddlers. Yet adolescence is the most formative period in our lives for adopting behaviors that ensure good health throughout life.</p>
			
			<h2>Depression</h2>
     		<p>One of the hallmarks of adolescence is moodiness. It is usually attributed to the stress of 
			growing up and the influence of hormones and brain development. But what happens 
			when it’s more than moodiness, or when sadness lingers or worsens and interferes with 
			your everyday life? 
			<p>Depression can change the way you see yourself, your life, and the people around you. It
			can affect your feelings of self-worth, motivation, and influence your perception of 
			danger and risk. 
			<p>When you are concerned about how you are feeling, it’s okay to reach out and ask for 
			help. There are adults who want to help. If you can’t get the help you need at home, a 
			teacher, counselor, or school nurse are good people to turn to. They can help get the 
			support you need to sort things out. 
			<p>For a list of clinics and mental health providers, <a href="clinic-finder.php">click here</a></p>
			<p><b>If you need immediate help, there are resources available to you:</b></p>
			<p><b>TEEN LINE</b>: The Teen Line is a service staffed by teenage volunteers who answer phone calls, emails and chats. It’s an organization based in Southern California, but they help people all over the country. The people who run Teen Line have been specially trained to help other young people. They won’t judge you or give advice – their job is to listen to your feelings and help you to clarify your concerns, define the options available to you, and help you make positive decisions. No problem is too small, too large, or too shocking for the Teen Line volunteers.</p>
			<p>If you’d like to talk with someone like you about the issues you are facing or feelings you are having, Teen Line is a confidential telephone helpline for teenage callers. Teen Line is open every evening from 8:00 pm to 12:00 pm (Chicago time), and the call is free. If you have a problem or just want to talk with another teen who understands, then this is the right place for you!</p>
			<p>You can call Teen Line at <a href="tel:1-800-852-8336">1-800-852-8336</a> and even text them by texting “TEEN” to 839863. Teen Line also offers  <a href="http://teenlineonline.org/boards/" target="_blank">message boards</a>, resources and information. You can visit their website  <a href="http://teenlineonline.org/" target="_blank">http://teenlineonline.org/</a> for more information.</p>
			<p><b>YOU MATTER</b>: If you or someone you know is considering suicide, <b><u>do not</b></u> hesitate to reach out for help.  Don’t worry about someone getting mad, at you, getting in trouble, or that you might be wrong or overreacting. It’s not worth taking a chance on staying quiet when someone could really be having a hard time and considering hurting themselves.</p>
			<p>You Matter is an organization for teens that provides information about a 24/7 suicide hotline number and online chat for when you need to talk to someone. They also have a blog about struggling with depression and suicide, as well as links to a variety of resources around the Web to learn more about how to help yourself or a friend who is struggling with depression and suicide.

				<h2>Disease Prevention</h2>
				<p>While immunizations for infants and young children are readily acknowledged as being vital to well-being, the importance of boosters and recommended vaccines for adolescents is not always recognized.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Since 2005, new vaccines have become available and are recommended for adolescents by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such vaccines include meningococcal (meningitis), human papillomavirus (HPV), and expanded recommendations for influenza (flu), as well as the Tdap vaccine, which expands the typical tetanus booster to include protection against pertussis (whooping cough).&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Adolescents and young adults need to continue their immunizations series and receive booster shots for ongoing protection against diseases and to help protect their families and communities by slowing or stopping disease outbreaks. &nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Vaccines Recommended for Adolescents&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
				<p><strong>Tdap Vaccine</strong> can prevent tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. It is recommended for adolescents because the immunization they received as children begins to wear off, making them more vulnerable to infection and unintentionally spreading the disease&mdash;a serious concern for babies not yet immunized.&nbsp;</span></p>
				<p>Tetanus</span> is a serious disease caused by a toxin (poison) made by bacteria that is commonly found in soil. Tetanus does not spread from person to person. The bacteria enter the body through scrapes, cuts or puncture wounds. Symptoms may include headache, feeling cranky, and muscle spasms that can cause breathing problems and paralysis. Three of ten people who get tetanus die from the disease.&nbsp;</span></p>
				<p>Diphtheria</span> is a serious disease that spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Diphtheria starts with sore throat, swollen glands in the neck, low-grade fever (101 degrees or less), and chills. 
				<p>It causes a thick coating in the back of the nose or throat that makes it hard to breathe or swallow. About one out of ten people who get diphtheria will die.</span></p>
				<p>Pertussis</span>&mdash;commonly referred to as whooping cough&mdash;is a very contagious&nbsp; respiratory disease. Pertussis can cause spells of violent coughing and choking, making it hard to breathe, drink, or eat.&nbsp; Pertussis can be fatal, especially in babies less than one year of age. They are too young to receive the vaccine and rely on the immunity of those around them to protect them.</span></p>
				<p><strong>Chickenpox</strong> is caused by the virus varicella zoster, which spreads very easily from infected people.&nbsp;</span></p>
				<p>Typical symptoms include an itchy rash with blisters, tiredness, headache and fever. Chickenpox is usually mild, but it can lead to severe skin infections, pneumonia, encephalitis (brain swelling), or even death.&nbsp;</span></p>
				<p><strong>Flu Vaccine</strong> can prevent&nbsp; influenza, which spreads easily when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Typical symptoms include a sudden high fever, chills, a dry cough, headache, runny nose, sore throat, and muscle and joint pain. Extreme fatigue can last from days to weeks. Hospitalization or even death among children with chronic diseases, and even among previously healthy children, can occur. Everyone 6 months or older should get the flu vaccine every year.</span></p>
				<p><strong>HPV Vaccine</strong> can prevent human papillomavirus which is common among adolescents and young adults. It is a major cause of cervical cancer in women and genital warts in women and men. HPV is spread through sexual contact. HPV can result in cervical, penile, anal, throat, mouth, vulvar, and vaginal cancer.</span></p>
				<p><strong>MCV Vaccine </strong>can prevent meningococcal diseases, including bacterial meningitis (infection around the brain and spinal cord) and widespread blood infection (sepsis). The bacteria are spread by coughing, sneezing or kissing. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, confusion and sleepiness. About one of every ten people who get the disease dies from it.</span></p>
				<p><em>Adolescents May Also Need Vaccination for:&nbsp;</em></span></p>
				<p><strong>Hepatitis A</strong> is an infection in the liver, which is spread through the fecal-oral route. Symptoms include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark urine, and jaundice. </span></p>
				<p>An infected person may have no symptoms, a mild illness, or a severe illness for several months.</span>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><strong>Hepatitis B</strong> is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus, which is 50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV. The virus is spread through exchange of blood or other body fluids. Symptoms include a flu-like illness with loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, rashes, joint pain,&nbsp; jaundice and may cause liver cancer.</span></p>
				<p><strong>MMR </strong>is a combination vaccine and booster that provides protection for:</span></p>
				<p>Measles</span> is one of the most contagious viral diseases and it is spread by direct contact with the airborne respiratory droplets of an infected person. Symptoms include a rash, fever, cough, and red, watery eyes and can also cause pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, or death.&nbsp;</span></p>
				<p>Mumps</span> is an infectious viral disease spread in the air by a cough or sneeze from an infected person or by coming in contact with a contaminated object, like a toy. The mumps virus causes fever, headaches, painful swelling of the salivary glands under the jaw, fever, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite.&nbsp;</span></p>
				<p>Rubella</span>, also known as German Measles, is caused by a virus that is spread through coughing and sneezing. Symptoms include fever, swollen glands, and a rash that lasts about three days. Rubella rarely causes serious illness or complications in children, but is very serious for pregnant woman and her fetus.</span></p>
				<p><strong>Polio</strong> is caused by a virus that is spread through contact with the feces (stool) or through droplets from a sneeze or cough. Symptoms typically include sudden fever, sore throat, headache, muscle weakness, and pain. In about one percent of cases, polio can cause paralysis and death.</span></p>
				<p><em>Other disease prevention strategies include:</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Regular physical exercise is a disease prevention strategy because it helps reduce risk of heart diseases, various cancers, and muscular- and skeletal diseases.</li>
					<li>Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables each day may reduce the risk of heart disease.</li>
					<li>Good oral health care (fluoride therapy and tooth cleaning), both at home and by a professional, prevents cavities, gum disease (gingivitis), tooth loss, and oral cancers.</li>
					<li>Condoms are sometimes referred to as &ldquo;prophylactics&rdquo; because they prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.</li>

				<h2>Nutrition and Physical Activity</h2>
				<p>Good nutrition and physical activity are essential to overall health and wellbeing. For decades, people have been flooded with messages about how regular exercise and healthy eating prevent diabetes, cancer, and heart disease, but studies have shown that a vast majority of Americans do not follow this advice.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>As a young person, you have an edge. If you are active and eating right, keep it up. These good habits will help you live a healthier, happier life. If you are needing to make some changes---increase your physical activity or add more vegetables to your diet---making them now is easier than later in life when it is sometimes more difficult to change.&nbsp;</p>
				<p><em>Obesity</em></p>
				<p>Obesity is a dangerous condition becoming more and more common in our culture. It is developing into a serious crisis in the teen population. The number of obese teenagers (aged 12 to 19 years) increased from 10.5 to 15.5 percent between 1988 and 2000. Obesity poses a threat to overall health, and is linked to heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, and even some cancers.</p>
				<p>Overweight adolescents and their parents must understand this is more than a cosmetic issue. Excess weight can have a long-term effect on your adult life and health.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Obesity as a chronic health problem has received more attention lately. Lawsuits have recently been filed against major fast food corporations serving high fat foods. On average, urban kids under the age of 17 visit fast food restaurants twice a week. Quick service, convenience, good taste and inexpensive prices are appealing to adolescents. Teens can afford to eat and socialize at these places. However, eating fast food too often can lead to rapid weight gain.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Part of growing up and becoming more independent involves making food choices on your own. With school, hobbies and after-school jobs, teens may spend a lot of time away from home. Still, it is important to eat on a regular schedule. It is thought that up to half of teens skip breakfast. Without breakfast, it is hard to stay awake and concentrate in school. Total nutrient intakes are lower in adolescents who miss breakfast. Breakfast may be skipped in a misguided attempt to reduce calories. Overeating at the next meal or snacking on high calorie and fat foods is often the result. What&rsquo;s more, kids who eat at least two consistent meals a day are leaner than those who do not. Those who eat more family meals also tend to be a normal weight and have better overall nutrition.</p>
				<p>The teen years are a time for learning to make wise food decisions. If poor eating habits are formed now, it is very difficult to acquire better habits later. Those who eat badly during adolescence risk obesity later in life. If eating well is unfamiliar and difficult for you, get one-on-one help by talking to a dietitian.</p>
				<p><em>Poor Nutrition and a Lack of Exercise Contribute to Chronic Disease</em></p>
				<p>Despite decades of research and a flood of messages, childhood obesity has more than tripled in the last 30 years, and today, nearly half of Chicago&rsquo;s youth are overweight or obese.<sup>1</sup> The scientific explanation is a caloric imbalance &ndash; too few calories expended for the amount consumed. However, genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors are also contributing factors.</p>
				<p>There&rsquo;s reason to be concerned about what you eat and how often you exercise. Rates of pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes among adolescents are skyrocketing.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>If you are 10 years of age and older and have a body mass index greater than the 85th percentile and have at least two other risk factors, such as family history, race/ethnicity, high blood pressure, and acanthosis nigricans (velvety dark skin changes of the neck, armpit, and groin), you should get screened.<sup>4</sup> By identifying pre-diabetes before it progresses to type 2 diabetes you can make healthy changes now and prevent a life-long chronic illness and devastating complications.</p>

				<li>Good food---fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains---are not just good for your heart and good for maintaining a healthy weight, it helps makes your brain work better.&nbsp;</li>

				<h2>Substance Use</h2>
				<p><b>Tobacco</b>
				<p>The negative health consequences of smoking are real. Heart disease, cancer, emphysema – these conditions can occur among youth who smoke. 
				<p>Smoking affects the quality of your life. It makes your clothes stink, it makes your breath stink (which makes you less kissable, just saying) and it’s expensive (more than $10 a pack in the City). Smoking will also shorten a person’s life by an average of 15 years. 
				<p>It’s not just smoking that hurts you. Chew, smokeless tobacco such as paan or gutkha, bidis, hookahs and kreteks are not safe alternatives. Despite their tasty flavors and perfume-like smells, these products contain hazardous toxins similar to regular cigarettes and can lead to the same negative health effects such as various types of cancer, bronchitis, lung disease, heart disease and asthma.

				<p><b>Alcohol and Other Drugs</b>
				<p>For most people, substance abuse and addiction have their beginnings in adolescence. Whether it’s alcohol, tobacco, ex, or weed, some researchers think that early experiments may have a bigger impact during adolescence because your brain is still growing and developing.  
				<p>Adults also worry because substance use - even casual weekend goofing - can lead to problems at school and home, the loss of friends and community support, lasting legal trouble, and other serious consequences. It can kill you. How?
				<p>Drugs and alcohol distort your ability to reason and impair your decision-making. It makes planning and calculating risk more difficult if not impossible. It also makes you more susceptible to suggestion and peer pressure, which increases the likelihood of unprotected sex, unintended pregnancies and STIs. Binge drinking and substance abuse can lead to reckless driving, resulting in injury or death, and suicides, violence, and drowning. 
				<p>If you need to talk to someone about your situation, there are adults who want to help. If you can’t get the help you need at home, a teacher, counselor, or school nurse are good people to turn to. They can help get the support you need to sort things out.

			<h2>Asthma</h2>
			<p>For people with asthma, breathing can be a daily challenge. Asthma is a condition where the bronchial 
			tubes (the tubes that bring air into your lungs) become inflamed making it difficult for air to pass through.
			While breathing, air comes in through the mouth or nose and then travels through the trachea (or wind 
			pipe). The air eventually makes its way to the bronchial tubes, then to the lungs, and then gets pushed 
			back out through the mouth and nose. If the bronchial tubes become inflamed, they produce large 
			quantities of mucus and their airways become blocked much easier. When this happens, you may 
			experience an asthma flare-up, also known as an asthma attack.
			
			<p>Although science understands how an asthma attack happens, it does not know why people develop 
			asthma to begin with. Asthma can be inherited, or passed down through the family genes, it could also be 
			a result of exposure to environmental factors: it is most likely a combination between the two. Either way,
			it is not contagious so you can’t catch it from students in your class or friends around your neighborhood. 
			<p>Also, the flare-ups that people with asthma experience can be triggered by many different things. It is 
			important to pay close attention to what triggers your asthma so that you can avoid those situations and 
			lead a healthier life. Some common triggers are:
			<ul>
			<li>Allergens like dust, mold, pollen, and animal dander.
			<li>Pollutants in the air such as smoke, smog, dust, perfumes, paint, and gasoline.
			<li>Exercise: although this can be frustrating if you want to engage in sports, consulting with a doctor
			can help you discover medication that can aid you in engaging in the activities you enjoy. Your 
			asthma shouldn’t discourage you from being physically active. Many athletes have asthma and 
			work hard to control their condition to stay active.
			<li>Cold and dry air, as well as extreme heat and humidity.
			<li>Other illnesses: for instance, colds, flus, strep throat, and other viruses.</ol>
			<p>There is no cure for asthma, but having it is not the end of the world. You can still lead a healthy, 
			productive life. Asthma is very manageable by educating yourself on the condition, avoiding 
			environments and activities that trigger your asthma, and through medication.     
				 <p>There are two primary types of asthma medication: rescue medications and controller medications. 
			Rescue medications act very quickly and help you get through an asthma attack as it is happening. These medicines are given orally with an inhaler and open up the blocked airways to allow air to get through. 
			<p>The other medications, known as controller medications, are not for immediate relief but try to treat the medicines 
			act very slowly and often take a week or more to start helping. 
			<p>Along with the medicine that you take, it is very important for you, your healthcare
			provider, and your parents to put together an asthma action plan. You should share
			this plan with your teachers and school nurse. This plan is critical to your health
			because it clearly lays out instructions for what should be done in case you have an
			asthma attack. This is important because asthma attacks are specific to each person
			who experiences it in a different way. This plan will detail when you should take
			your medication, how much medication should be taken, and the difference
			between when a doctor needs to be called and when you need to go to the emergency room. 
			<p>Your action plan should have other important information such as: emergency phone numbers, a list of 
			triggers and how to avoid them and the names of your medications and how much too normally take. 
			While talking about this with your doctor and parents you may discover other information to put on your asthma action plan.

      		<h2>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</h2>
			<p>Sometimes it is hard to concentrate, especially if the television is turned on, kids are playing in other parts
			of the room, or your parents are making dinner while you’re studying. Sometimes people can have a 
			really hard time sitting still, focusing, and paying attention even if nothing else is going on in the room. This is sometimes caused by attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. ADHD is a general 
			disorder that can affect each person differently. Some signs are:</p>
			<ul><li>Problems staying focused.</li>
			<li>Difficulty finishing assignments.</li>
			<li>Trouble following instructions.</li>
			<li>Loses things such as homework.</li>
			<li>Easily distracted, even while engaged in fun activities.</li>
			<li>Trouble with attention to detail.</li>
			<li>Struggles with organizing activities.</li>
			<li>Finds it hard to wait their turn.</li>
			<li>Interrupts others before they are finished speaking.</li>
			<li>Fidgets with hands or feet.</li>
			<li>Talks rapidly and moves on before others respond.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Nobody actually knows what causes ADHD. Some doctors think it is genetic, or passed down through the
			family. It is often found in children born prematurely and in boys more than girls. Doctors do know that 
			low amounts of dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps with attention, leads to a greater chance of 
			ADHD.</p>
			<p>Since ADHD affects everyone differently, there is no cure for it and treatment is given differently to each 
			person who is affected. Sometimes people with ADHD are given medication that helps them concentrate 
			and stay focused. This medicine also can help you stay calm and usually only needs to be taken once a 
			day. Sometimes it is good to talk to a counselor on a regular basis. You may also go see this counselor 
			with your family. This is so that your family can learn how they can best help you and so they can stay 
			informed about how ADHD is affecting you. Sometimes schools will put together a plan for your teachers
			to follow while you are in class with them, so that they can better help you learn at school.</p>
			<p>There are things you can do to help with your ADHD. You can sit in the front of the class so that there are
			fewer distractions during school. Turn off the TV while studying or reading. Talk with a teacher or parent 
			if you are having trouble concentrating or focusing. Keep all your school supplies and important 
			documents at home organized. Get lots of exercise and take short breaks while doing schoolwork. Talk to 
			your friends about what having ADHD means. Stay positive!</p>
			<ul><li>Accept your diagnosis: You don’t have ADHD because of anything you did wrong; it simply 
			is the way your brain is wired.</li>
			<li>Practice self-care: sometimes people who have ADHD can become concentrated on a task 
			and forget to take care of themselves. Plan breaks throughout the day to stop and ask yourself
			if you need anything at the moment, perhaps to eat, take a nap, sleep for the night, or move on
			to a different task. </li>
			<li>Be sure to get plenty of sleep.</li>
			<li>Use pill containers to ensure proper dosage and to track if you have already taken your 
			medication for the day.</li>
			<li>Practice self-control: People with ADHD are at a higher risk for addiction. Keep yourself 
			interested in stimulating activities, such as art, music, dancing, etc.</li> 
			<li>Keep a notebook: ADHD often times causes people to day-dream and/or forget conversations 
			and thoughts. Keeping a journal or notebook and writing down thoughts you have and people 
			you meet will help you remember your ideas.</li> 
			<li>Keep a planner: be sure to write down all your daily events and appointments.</li>
			<li>Set alarms: keep yourself on time by setting your bedroom alarm, or alarms on a cell phone to
			help you keep track of your daily activities.</li>
			<li>Just say no: Many who have ADHD are very kind, caring individuals who often become 
			overstressed due to their willingness to please others. Be conscious about how many people 
			you have agreed to help. When others ask for your help, let them know you’ll think about it 
			to give yourself time to consider the implications of it.</li>
			<li>Seek support: Don’t be afraid to ask a parent, doctor, or teacher for help. If you’re having 
			trouble focusing in school, speak with your teachers to see if a plan can be developed to 
			facilitate your learning environment.</li></ul>

			<h2>Diabetes</h2>
			<p>Diabetes affects your body&rsquo;s ability to produce or use glucose (sugar). More and more young people are being diagnosed with diabetes. If you have this condition, or are at risk for developing diabetes, you need to take action now to safeguard your health. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>Glucose is the fuel that powers your body and it&rsquo;s in nearly everything we eat---fruits, vegetables, breads----not just candies and sodas. To get glucose into the cells, your body produced insulin. Insulin is a hormone that works like a doorman, allowing glucose to enter into your cells and energize you.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>But when a person has diabetes, either the insulin isn&rsquo;t doing the job that it should (Type 2 diabetes) or the body doesn&rsquo;t make any insulin at all (Type 1 diabetes). With both types of diabetes, too much sugar can build up in the blood, which will make you very sick damage your eyesight, your kidneys, your heart, and circulation, which can lead to amputations.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>There is another big difference between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. Scientists don&rsquo;t know what causes diabetes but they think that both genes and the environment are factors. It&rsquo;s an autoimmune disease that shuts down your pancreas so you no longer make insulin.&nbsp; People with type I diabetes will have to take insulin with every meal, every day to stay alive. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>Type 2 Diabetes usually develops in people who are overweight and who don&rsquo;t exercise. Extra weight and an inactive lifestyle make it harder for insulin to work properly. It is possible to prevent Type 2 diabetes by getting plenty of exercise and eating healthy foods. Here are some steps you can take to help prevent Type 2 diabetes:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and proteins</li>
			<li>Make your calories count. Keep your intake of sugary, refined, starchy, and fatty foods to a minimum.</li>
			<li>Decrease your soda intake. Did you know that people who drink a soda every day are more at risk for developing Type 2 than a person who is overweight?</li>
			<li>Make fewer trips to fast food restaurants&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Exercise every day. Just 30 minutes a day is enough to protect your health. Playing sports is a great way to stay healthy!</li>
			<li>Talk with your parents, your teachers, and your healthcare provider about your physical health and what you can do to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>But Type 2 diabetes isn&rsquo;t just about how much a person weighs or what kind of food they eat (or don&rsquo;t eat). Genetics plays a role, too. For example, skinny people can get Type 2 diabetes and African Americans and Hispanic people face higher risks for developing Type 2.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Many students with diabetes manage their condition independently. However, if a person&rsquo;s blood sugar level drops too low, they may require emergency medication called Glucagon.&nbsp;</p>

			<h2>Epilepsy/Seizure Disorder</h2>
			<p>Epilepsy/seizure disorder is more common that most people realize. About one person in a hundred lives with this disorder, which often begins in childhood. It is a disorder, not a disease; it&rsquo;s not something you &ldquo;catch&rdquo; by being around a person with this disorder.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Epilepsy /seizure disorder is not a mental disorder. It is a physical disorder formed by sudden or brief changes in how the brain works. It is a symptom of a neurological disorder that affects the brain and shows itself in the form of seizures.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>A seizure occurs when the normal electrical balance in the brain is lost. The brain's nerve cells fall through; they either ignite when they shouldn't or don't ignite when they should. The result is a sudden, brief, uncontrolled rush of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures are the physical effects of such unusual bursts of electrical energy in the brain. These overactive signals may keep the brain from understanding what the eyes see. The person may stare during a seizure, or they may affect leg muscle tone and cause a person to fall down. The type of seizure depends on how many cells are launched and which area of the brain is involved. A seizure may be a change in behavior, consciousness, movement, perception and or sensation.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Drugs don&rsquo;t cure epilepsy/seizure disorder, but they often reduce or even stop seizures from occurring by altering the activity of neurons in the brain. Most students achieve seizure control with medication. Sometimes, though, a student will experience what&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;break-through&rdquo; seizure, which is <span class="s7">a bout of seizure activity that requires immediate emergency attention, including medication called DiaStat.</p>

			<h2>Food Allergies</h2>
			<p>Food Allergies are becoming more and more common for children and adolescents.&nbsp; It is estimated that about 3 million kids in the US have food allergies and it is constantly growing.&nbsp; Food allergies are very serious and unfortunately can be fatal for some people. It is a condition that needs to be taken very seriously.</p>
			<p>A food allergy is different than food intolerance. Some key facts about food allergy:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Food allergy is an overreaction of the immune system to a food protein. Allergic reactions will happen each and every time you eat that food.&nbsp; Reactions will happen fast- within minutes to 2 hours.</li>
			<li>It may take only a tiny or even a miniscule amount of food to cause a reaction.&nbsp; For example, if someone touches something they are allergic to, and then they rub their nose or eyes, open areas of skin or put their hands in their mouth, this could be enough to cause a reaction.</li>
			<li>The severity and progress of an allergic reaction is <span class="s1">unpredictable: a mild reaction can become severe within minutes.&nbsp; Reactions can be different for everyone, and reactions can even be different each time for the same person &ndash; very unpredictable!&nbsp; For this reason, all allergic symptoms a person has with food allergy must be taken very seriously. All food allergies are potentially life threatening.&nbsp;</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The top 8 most common food allergies are:</p>
			<p><img src="images/food_stuff.png"></p>
		
			<p><em>Ways to treat food allergies:</em></p>
			<p>Unfortunately, there is no cure for food allergies, but for some people they will grow out of certain food allergies during their lifetime.&nbsp; Everyone can develop a food allergy at some point in his or her life.&nbsp; Just because you didn&rsquo;t get one when you were young doesn&rsquo;t mean you can develop one as a teenager or adult.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><em>The best way to manage and treat food allergies is by:</em>&nbsp;</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Preventing Reactions &ndash; avoiding the foods that you are allergic too and cross contamination with those foods. Read food labels and always make sure you know exactly what you are going to eat</li>
			<li>Recognize reactions &ndash; take all allergic reactions seriously (see examples in picture below)</li>
			<li>Respond to reactions &ndash; don&rsquo;t minimize symptoms, wait, or think they&rsquo;ll just go away. Act quickly. The motto is: If it&rsquo;s more than skin, stick it in. In other words, if a person other symptoms in addition to a rash, they need emergency medication.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Save a life. Use an Epinephrine Auto Injector (EpiPen) and call 911.&nbsp;</li>

			<h2>High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)</h2>
			<p>Evidence suggests that having high blood pressure (hypertension) in childhood is linked to high blood pressure as an adult. The condition is also genetic (inherited). It can lead to an increased risk of strokes, heart attacks or heart failure, as well as kidney disease. High blood pressure may have no symptoms but severe cases may involve chest pain, headaches, and blurred vision.</p>
			<p>Body size is the biggest predictor of high blood pressure in children. About half of children with high blood pressure are very overweight or obese. Losing weight can improve blood pressure. Girls with this condition who are on birth control pills must be monitored, since the pill tends to make it worse. Drinking alcohol and smoking can also increase blood pressure.</p>
			<p>Finding out if you have high blood pressure is easy and painless. It involves taking a reading. Normal blood pressure shows a systolic (top) number less than 130 and a diastolic (bottom) number less than 80. To be sure of a true reading, blood pressure should be properly checked at least twice at two or more doctor&rsquo;s visits. Some people have something called &lsquo;white coat anxiety hypertension.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s not really hypertension but they get nervous at the doctor&rsquo;s office and this makes their blood pressure goes up. After they have met the doctor more than once, their blood pressure reading lowers.&nbsp;</p>

			<h2>Sickle Cell Anemia</h2>

			<p>It may seem strange, but inside your blood are tiny little cells called red blood cells. What is even crazier, these red blood cells are actually made in your bones! Every time you breathe, bone marrow creates red blood cells and releases them into your blood to carry oxygen throughout your body. Oxygen is really important for your body, and these red blood cells are usually rounded since it is the easiest way for them to move through your blood stream. Sometimes a person doesn&rsquo;t have enough red blood cells. This is called anemia. It means that people who have anemia have less oxygen throughout their body. Sometimes anemia is caused because the red blood cells are not round but sickle shaped. A sickle shape looks like a crescent moon. When a person has sickle shaped red blood cells, it is called sickle cell anemia. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>The problem with sickle cell anemia is that the sickle-shaped red blood cells do not move as easily through the blood stream. They can become stuck and make it hard for blood to flow through the body. This can cause pain in the bones, and can be dangerous to organs that need a constant supply of blood, like the brain, heart, and kidneys. The body knows to destroy the sickle cells, but it can do so quicker than the body can make new blood cells. This causes anemia.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If you have sickle cell anemia you may feel pain in your chest, stomach, or bones when blood gets blocked because of sickle shaped cells. This pain may last a few minutes or even a couple of days; it might hurt a lot or just a little. Nobody can tell when this pain might happen, it all depends on if a sickle cell gets stuck. However, being too cold, getting sick, and not drinking enough fluids can make it happen more often. Also, if you have sickle cell anemia, you may get tired easily or become sick more often than other children. You may also not grow as fast as your friends and classmates.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Sickle cell anemia is not a disease you can catch or pass on to your friends or family. It is genetic, which means it is passed down from being born into a family that has had that disease before. A doctor can find out if you have sickle cell anemia by doing special blood tests. These tests will let the doctor look at hemoglobin, a part of the blood that carries oxygen throughout the body inside the red blood cells. If the doctor finds the right kind of hemoglobin, it means they have discovered sickle cell anemia in the blood.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>To help with sickle cell anemia, a doctor may prescribe penicillin. Doctors may also have you take a vitamin called folic acid, which helps the body make new red blood cells. Although these medicines will not cure sickle cell anemia, they will help you stay healthy and prevent sickness that would increase the chance of sickle cells becoming stuck. The doctor may also give you pain medicine to help you feel better when it does happen. If the pain is too much or lasts too long, you may go to the hospital for antibiotics or more pain medicine. In some cases, you may go to the hospital for a blood transfusion. This is when the doctor puts healthy blood cells into your body, which makes it easier for the blood to flow and carry the oxygen you need.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Not only will taking the penicillin and vitamins help you stay healthy and feel less pain, but so will eating healthy foods and drinks, and sleeping well. You can also play and exercise, but remember to not get too hot, cold, or tired. Talk with your parents and doctor about good activities you can do every day to help you stay healthy. Remember that if you feel any pain or have a fever, tell an adult right away. The sooner you get help the faster you can feel well.</p>

			<h2>HIV Infection</h2>
			<p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects cells of the immune system, destroying or impairing their ability to function properly. As the infection progresses, the immune system becomes weaker, and the person becomes more susceptible to infections. The most advanced stage of HIV infection is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It can take 10-15 years for an HIV-infected person to develop AIDS; antiretroviral drugs can slow down the process even further.</p>
			<p>HIV is transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse (anal or vaginal), transfusion of contaminated blood, sharing of contaminated needles, and between a mother and her infant during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding.</p>
