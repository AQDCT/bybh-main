      <h2>Talk to Your Parents</h2>
     <p>It might not seem like it, but your parents were once young just like 
you. And they had a lot of the same questions that you have today. 
Whether it’s about vaccines, alcohol use, dealing with a bully, or 
worries about relationships and sex, your parents have traveled some 
of this ground and may be your best, local resource for information and
support. 
<p>It’s normal to feel nervous about talking with your parents, especially 
about relationships and sex, but a lot of parents say they are relieved 
when their teens start this conversation. 
<p>When it comes to discussing sex, parents can react in many different 
ways. Some may get very worried right away, become angry and 
defensive, interrupt, talk over you, or worse, jump to conclusions 
before you’ve had a chance to say anything. Some may be supportive, 
compassionate, and informed. And some may be too embarrassed to 
say anything at all. Some parents try to get the whole thing over with 
in one big talk, or they don’t want to talk about it at all. Be patient 
with them!
<p>Most often, ongoing communication gets easier and feels more 
comfortable — and is good for you, too. But how do you start a 
conversation?
<p>When you’re ready to bring it up, you could try using a TV show as a 
starting point or something you recently read, or an example of 
someone you know. You could try making a joke about where babies 
come from, or where you thought babies came from when you were 
younger, “Mom, the secret’s out. I know babies don’t really get 
delivered by a stork.” Opening the conversation with humor might 
make it easier to get started and put everyone at ease.
<p>It may take more than one conversation about this issue before you 
feel comfortable disclosing information about your own personal 
feelings, experiences, and intentions.
<p>Rather than having a formal sit-down at a table with your parents, 
some people find it easier to discuss in the car so that you don’t have 
to have an ‘eye-to-eye’ conversation. This can also keep a parent from 
chickening out!
<p>If you are concerned that your parents will get upset, you might want 
to put off this conversation until you feel that you and your parents are
ready. Meanwhile, you could turn to another trusted adult, like your pastor or priest or your school nurse, teacher or counselor. This could 
give you the opportunity to rehearse this talk with an adult you trust, 
so you can prepare what you want to say to your parents.
