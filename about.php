				<p>The Office of Adolescent and School Health (OASH), in collaboration with the Chicago Public
				Schools (CPS), is implementing a five-year, $19.7 million grant, the centerpiece of which is the
				Teen Outreach Program (TOP), an evidence-based youth development curriculum. Positive
				youth development programs such as TOP have been shown to reduce teen pregnancies by
				more than 50 percent while increasing attendance and graduation rates.</p>

				<p>As a part of this grant, OASH convenes a citywide committee of more than 50 health advocates,
				health care policy makers, service providers, and other stakeholders invested in improving
				the health of adolescents in Chicago. The Adolescent Health Access Committee (AHAC) is
				commissioned to develop and a data-driven strategic action plan to that leverage stakeholder
				strengths to increase access, improve provider engagement, and improve adolescent health.</p>

				<p>This action plan identifies more than 50 health goals and includes baseline data, health
				improvements to be made by 2020, a set of policy, programming, and public awareness
				strategies to reach these goals. Data are drawn from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance
				System (YRBSS), which monitors health-risk behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of
				death and disability among youth and adults; the National Immunization Survey (NIS), which
				monitors childhood immunization coverage; the Illinois Youth Survey (ILS), which gathers
				information about a variety of health and social indicators including substance use patterns
				and attitudes of Illinois youth; and data collected by the Chicago Department of Public Health
				Office of Epidemiology and Public Health Informatics. These data will be updated and published
				annually and used to inform policy and to develop data-driven programs.</p>

				<p>OASH is also developing a Condom Availability Program for CPS in collaboration with faculty
				and students at Columbia College Chicago. The program will provide free condoms and health
				literature in select high schools where a trained, trusted adult will be available to discuss health
				issues and provide referrals. CDPH will collect and report data which can be used inform policy
				guidelines and program expansion.</p>

				<p>Finally, using direct and social marketing strategies, OASH works to raise awareness about
				adolescent health issues and provide adolescents and other stakeholders the information they
				need to make positive contributions towards the improvement of adolescent health in Chicago.
